# The code for the Monte Carlo Concrete DropPath method
 The method is for epistemic uncertainty estimation and is based on the Scheduled DropPath technique + Concrete distribution.
 

 
First it was proposed for the task of brain tumor segmentation and this is its version for the image classification taks. See the implementation for segmentation here https://github.com/Vole1/MC-CDP-BraTS2018.
 
Some parts of the code are adapted from https://github.com/selimsef/dsb2018_topcoders/. Readme will be updated later.
